<p>This is a letter from the Brooklyn Area I Policy Aide in address to the Albany office of the New York State Department 
of Corrections and Community Supervision (NYSDCCS). The purpose of this letter is to offer policy solutions to
the growing problem of inmate reentry into society. This letter will focus on solutions to former inmate homelessness, unemployment, and recidivism. 
First, I will present to headquarters data concerning the recent problem of inmate reentry.</p>

<p>Formerly incarcerated homeless people have been an increasingly high phenomenon in the United States.
Couloute (2018) cites a report that estimates that formerly incarcerated people are ten times more likely to be homeless
than non-formerly incarcerated people. The report further stratifies this data into categories of race, sex, age, 
history of incarceration, and time since release. There is strong evidence to show that Black people, women, people over the age of 45,
repeat incarcerated individuals, and those less than two years since release are at greater risk of being homeless (Couloute 2018). 
The current research in the field also shows that the problem of formerly incarcerated homelessness is interrelated to the issues of 
unemployment and recidivism.</p>

<p>Chappell (2018) discusses the prison-to-shelter pipeline that many formerly incarcerated members of society encounter. 
There has been a growing trend of the homeless population relying on the shelter system. 
In fact, from a recent estimation of 9,300 prisoners that were paroled from state prisons in 2017 about “54 percent 
(around 5,000) went directly to shelters – up from 23 percent just three years earlier” 
(Chappell, 2018, p.54). Many of these formerly incarcerated individuals rely on the shelter system because of 
housing insecurity. In New York City, about 1,600 parolees are within the shelter system at any given time (Chappell 2018). 
New York City is well known in the state of New York for housing programs such as Advantage, Special Exit and Prevention Supplement 
(SEPS), and the FUSE project. Still, it is apparent from the data that homelessness is an enduring problem for the formerly incarcerated. 
Per every 10,000 formerly incarcerated aggregate across the U.S.A. 203 people are homeless, 367 live in Marginal Housing, and 570 
are “housing insecure” (Couloute 2018).</p>

<p>Current research in Criminal Justice and Corrections reveals that formerly incarcerated people are discriminated against in 
the labor market. Bureau of Labor Statistics writer Dunn (2015) cites author Steven Raphael: “Perceptions on the demand side of the 
labor market regarding specific risks associated with an applicant’s criminal record, whether justified or not, certainly [limit] the employment 
opportunities available to former inmates.” In fact, Raphael provides that approximately 37% of California employers reject applicants with criminal 
records (Dunn 2015). Ironically, economists have frequently projected that the U.S. is struggling to recruit and retain labor. 
There is an estimation that about 27% of all formerly incarcerated people are not in the labor force (Couloute & Kopf 2018). 
What this means is that there is a growing, underutilized population who could occupy places of employment.</p>

<p>Homelessness combined with unemployment has been shown to lead to recidivism in the literature. According to the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (2014), there was a total of 228,100 people in the New York State Corrections population (Glaze & Kaeble 11). About 40.9% of 
prisoners released returned to prison within the fiscal year of 2014 (B.J.A. 2014). Goldstein (2014) reported that the math is consistent with 
the recidivism rate since 1996. Recidivism appears to be lowest when people are offered opportunities (such as jobs, education, and access to housing) 
that dissuade them from re-offending. Our own Governor Cuomo praised the Bard Prison Initiative, which is a program that provides liberal arts college classes 
to inmates, for its 5% recidivism rate. However, program founder Max Kenner stated that the program needed more work to prove successful (Goldstein 2014).</p>
